# `unsized_types`

RFC: *comming soon*

Examples:

- `dense`: An implementation of a dense matrix that demonstrates the increased usability of the
  `Index` and `Deref` traits.

- `sparse`: An implementation of a sparse matrix that showcases custom destructors on unsized
  types.

- `slice`: A re-implementation of the built-in `[T]` type.
